            Insecure default configuration of Salt stack

Summary
========

Salt stack in Qubes OS, among other things, can be used to configure software
installed in qubes (including TemplateVMs and AppVMs)[1]. To isolate dom0 from
potentially compromised qubes, a Disposable VM is used between dom0 and a
target qube to contain all the complex processing there[2]. Each target qube
gets a separate Disposable VM, which is given power to execute arbitrary
commands (through qubes.VMShell qrexec service) in that target qube.

In default configuration, this Disposable VM is based on the same DVM template
that is set for all the other actions (including default Disposable: Firefox
menu entry). This DVM template has a red label and has networking enabled,
which may suggest it isn't a security critical element.  If that default DVM
template is compromised (for example by a web browser plugin user installs
there[3]), the next time the user uses Salt stack, it could also compromise
all target qubes.

Additionally, the option to use an alternative DVM template for Salt was not
exposed in user interface - neither command line nor graphical.

Vulnerable systems
==================

To exploit this vulnerability, several condition needs to be met:

1. The user needs to use Salt stack to configure software inside qubes (it
   isn't by default). Only qubes configured by Salt would be affected.

2. The user needs to customize the default DVM template without realizing the
   security implications - this is where potential compromise could happen.

The issue applies only to Qubes 4.0. In Qubes 3.2 a temporarily created AppVM
based on the default Template is used.

Resolution
==========

To fix this problem, we've made two changes:

1. Added "management_dispvm" qube property to specify which DVM template should
   be used to manage the qube in question. The property is inherited from
   TemplateVMs to TemplateBasedVMs and if none of them are set explicitly, the
   default is taken from the global "management_dispvm" property. The per-qube
   one is available through `qvm-prefs` utility, the global one - through
   `qubes-prefs`.

2. Created `default-mgmt-dvm` DVM template, which is hidden from the menu (to
   avoid accidental usage), has networking disabled and has a black label (same
   as templates). This qube is set as global "management_dispvm".

Patching
=========

The specific packages that resolve the problems discussed in this
bulletin are as follows:

  For Qubes OS 4.0:
  - qubes-core-dom0 version 4.0.36
  - qubes-mgmt-salt-dom0-virtual-machines version 4.0.15
  - qubes-mgmt-salt-admin-tools version 4.0.12

The packages are to be installed in dom0 via the Qubes VM Manager or via
the qubes-dom0-update command as follows:

  For updates from the stable repository (not immediately available):
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update

  For updates from the security-testing repository:
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-dom0-security-testing

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community.
