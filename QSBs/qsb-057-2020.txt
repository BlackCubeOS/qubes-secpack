      Special Register Buffer speculative side channel (XSA-320)

Summary
========

On 2020-06-09, the Xen Security Team published Xen Security Advisory
320 (CVE-2020-0543 / XSA-320) [1] with the following description:

| This issue is related to the MDS and TAA vulnerabilities.  Please see
| https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-297.html (MDS) and
| https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-305.html (TAA) for details.
| 
| Certain processor operations microarchitecturally need to read data from
| outside the physical core (e.g. to communicate with the random number
| generator).  In some implementations, this operation is called a Special
| Register Read.
| 
| In some implementations, data are staged in a single shared buffer, and
| a full cache line at a time is returned to the core which made the
| Special Register Read.  On parts vulnerable to MFBDS or TAA, an attacker
| may be able to access stale data requested by other cores in the system.
| 
| For more details, see:
|   https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00320.html
| 
| 
| An attacker, which could include a malicious untrusted user process on a
| trusted guest, or an untrusted guest, can sample the contents of
| certain off-core accesses by other cores in the system.
| 
| This can include data whose use may depend on the secrecy of the value,
| such as data from the Random Number Generator (e.g. RDRAND/RDSEED
| instructions).

This is yet another CPU hardware bug related to speculative execution.

Only Intel processors are affected. RDRAND instruction is available in
Intel processors starting with Ivy Bridge (3rd gen Intel Core). See
Intel's advisory for a full list of affected CPUs (short version: most
mobile/desktop CPUs are affected, most Atoms and server Xeons not).

Impact
=======

An attacker can obtain data returned by RDRAND/RDSEED instructions on
another core on the system (including another VM). In practice, Linux
does use RDRAND/RDSEED to seed it's random number generator
(/dev/urandom, getrandom(2) etc.), but RDRAND/RDSEED is not the only
source of entropy. So, as long as other sources of entropy are not
compromised, the overall security of the random number generator is
still preserved. In Qubes OS this is additionally improved by seeding
the random number generator at VM startup time using a random seed
provided from dom0. This means using Linux's random number generator is
still safe.

Besides Linux kernel using RDRAND/RDSEED as one of entropy sources,
userspace application can also issue RDRAND/RDSEED instructions on its
own. Such software is affected by the bug discussed here. Specific
impact depends on what application does with random data obtained this
way.


Patching
=========

Intel has provided a microcode update that mitigate the issue. 
Please note Ivy Bridge processors are considered retired by Intel and
do not receive microcode updates anymore. This means Ivy Bridge
processors remains vulnerable to this issue. To mitigate the problem,
we are masking out RDRAND availability to VMs on those affected
platforms.

The specific packages that resolve the problems discussed in this
bulletin are as follows:

  For Qubes 4.0:
  - microcode_ctl 2.1-30.qubes1
  - qubes-core-dom0 4.0.51 (needed for Ivy Bridge platforms only)

The packages are to be installed in dom0 via the Qubes VM Manager or via
the qubes-dom0-update command as follows:

  For updates from the stable repository (not immediately available):
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update

  For updates from the security-testing repository:
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-dom0-security-testing

A system restart will be required afterwards.

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
microcode binaries.
