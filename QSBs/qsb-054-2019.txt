                Ineffective fix for XSA-302 (XSA-306)

Summary
========

On 2019-11-26, the Xen Security Team published the following Xen
Security Advisories (XSAs):

XSA-306 [1] "Device quarantine for alternate pci assignment methods":
| XSA-302 relies on the use of libxl's "assignable-add" feature to
| prepare devices to be assigned to untrusted guests.
| 
| Unfortunately, this is not considered a strictly required step for
| device assignment.  The PCI passthrough documentation on the wiki
| describes alternate ways of preparing devices for assignment, and
| libvirt uses its own ways as well.  Hosts where these "alternate"
| methods are used will still leave the system in a vulnerable state
| after the device comes back from a guest.
| 
| An untrusted domain with access to a physical device can DMA into host
| memory, leading to privilege escalation.


Impact
=======

The issue makes original XSA-302[2] fix ineffective in the configuration
used on Qubes OS. See QSB #52[3] for detailed discussion about the
impact.


Discussion
===========

The issue has been discovered by the Qubes Security Team during
re-verification of QSB #52 fixes, but unfortunately at that time
XSA-302 and QSB #52 were already public. Based on the Xen Security
Policy[4] and discussion with the Xen Security Team we've decided to
treat it as a separate issue, with a separate embargo.
The new proposed fix for PCI devices isolation is much less
fragile, because it does not depend on toolstack (libxl) behavior
anymore.


Patching
=========

The specific packages that resolve the problems discussed in this
bulletin are as follows:

  For Qubes OS 4.0:
  - Xen packages version 4.8.5-13

The packages are to be installed in dom0 via the Qubes VM Manager or via
the qubes-dom0-update command as follows:

  For updates from the stable repository (not immediately available):
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update

  For updates from the security-testing repository:
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-dom0-security-testing

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.
